# Leap plugin for AttractMode front end

by [Keil Miller Jr](http://keilmiller.com)

## DESCRIPTION:

Leap plugin is for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It helps to leap over empty filters. This is important for filters like favorites that might be empty at times, and cause issues with your layout.

## Paths

You may need to change file paths as necessary as each platform (windows, mac, linux) has a slightly different directory structure.

## Install Files

1. Copy plugin files to `$HOME/.attract/plugins/Leap/`.

## Usage

You can enable the Leap plugin by running Attract Mode and pressing the tab key to enter the configure menu. Navigate to `Plug-ins -> Leap -> Enabled`.

## Notes

More functionality is expected as it meets my needs. If you have an idea of something to add that might benefit a wide range of layout developers, please join the AttractMode forum and send me a message.
